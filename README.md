This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

# Reddit Reader

An application that streamlines looking at posts from certain subreddits. 

For the client, I used the React framework and bootstrapped it with the 'Create React App' npm module.

Starting the application.

1) Within the root directory, run 'npm install'
  - This will install all the dependencies for the client

2) Within the root directory, run 'npm start'
  - This will start the app in development mode

To access the app, in your web browser go to localhost:3000
